# gulp-salesforce-mavensmate-template
A template setup to work with mavensmate using gulp to keep your work in a separate directory
This setup uses the atom editor, mavensmate, mavensmate-atom plugin
To begin - create a directory with these directories (or named similar) inside: 'mavensmate' and 'source'
Edit the file paths in your gulpfile as needed.
In your terminal:
npm install
gulp transfer

Then check the markup folder to confirm your project directories and their contents have come to your source folder.
Now you have a backup - so run this before you pull from mavensmate to avoid problems from code changes made by other developers.
